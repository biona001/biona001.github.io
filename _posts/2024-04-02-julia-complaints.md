Long post warning; TLDR at the end.

I am a scientist who needs to write high performance code. I started with Julia around 2017 (julia v0.5), and so far everything I needed has worked. I love the language and I want to continue using it for everything.

But lately I have a gut feeling that changing to R/C++, Python/Rust, or something similar could make my life easier *in the long run*. Even so, based on my understanding of myself, I think I will not make the transition anytime soon. Thus, I'm writing this post right now so future me can decide whether I made the wrong call or not.

**The main problem is that I don't like to "hack around", and increasingly I feel like using Julia will *require* me to do so.**

Here are some examples of what I mean: 

1. I needed to call some C++ code in Julia. The Julian way of doing so, afaik, is (a) manually write the wrapper code **all in C++**, (b) use `CxxWrap.jl` to call the shared library, (c) create a `jll` package via `BinayBuilder.jl`, (d) upload to Yggdrasil, (e) write a regular Julia package that depends on said `jll`, and FINALLY I can call C++ code from julia. This is significantly more complex than I initially imagined, and many of the intermediate steps had little documentions/tutorials. If I encounter any difficulties in any of these steps, like I did [here](https://github.com/JuliaInterop/CxxWrap.jl/issues/395) and [here](https://github.com/JuliaPackaging/BinaryBuilder.jl/issues/1306), I feel like only 1-2 people in the world would be able to help me (thankfully, they did help).
2. I wanted to create binaries using `PackageCompiler.jl`. It is one of the most popular packages in Julia, so I figured it would be safe to rely on it. Unfortunately I encountered some [troubles](https://discourse.julialang.org/t/packages-with-init-screws-up-packagecompiler-jl/112243), **which is fine**, because popular packages can have rough edges too. But it took me 1-2 weeks just to get to the bottom of the issue, because the problems I encounter (e.g. [here](https://github.com/JuliaLang/PackageCompiler.jl/issues/933) and [here](https://github.com/JuliaLang/PackageCompiler.jl/issues/927)) were too ambiguous/complex to get describe and were thus ignored. My current solution is very non-ideal, but I had no choice. Did I mention one can compile cross-platform binaries with `BinaryBuilder.jl` but [cannot with PackageCompiler.jl](https://github.com/JuliaLang/PackageCompiler.jl/issues/879)? Feels like if you can do one you should be able to do the other.
3. I recently picked up an old project which required solving a large non-linear optimization problem. It internally used `MathProgBase.jl` to interface with the Ipopt solver, so naturally the first step is to replace it with `MathOptInterface.jl`. While a [tutorial exists](https://jump.dev/MathOptInterface.jl/dev/tutorials/mathprogbase/#Transitioning-from-MathProgBase), I was immedaitely greeted with [a big fat danger sign](https://jump.dev/MathOptInterface.jl/dev/tutorials/implementing/#Implementing-a-solver-interface) that basically says I probably don't want to do this. Fortunately, the translation went smoothly, so that was a big win. However, I definitely want my packages to function without too much maintenance effort. This is pretty hard when something internal like `MathProgBase.jl` or something as big as `LoopVectorization.jl` can basically just become deprecated within a few years. I mean, I wrote [a paper](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/39/4/btad193/7126408?login=true) whose (impressive) benchmark relies heavily on `LoopVectorization.jl`, so I'm not quite sure what to do if it becomes deprecated in Julia v1.11+. 
4. I wrote an [R](https://github.com/biona001/knockoffsr) and another [python](https://github.com/biona001/knockoffspy) package to wrap one of my julia package, following the example of `DifferentialEquations.jl`. As much as I like Julia, I want my work to be relevant to my collaborators who mostly live in R/Python world. Unfortunately `JuliaCall` (which handles the interfacing between R and Julia) appears to be abandoned, and even basic [installation issues](https://github.com/Non-Contradiction/JuliaCall/issues/198) will likely never get resolved. As a result, half the time my collaborators cannot successfully install these wrappers without my help. I really thought it'll be pretty cool to suggest R/Julia rather than R/C++, but I guess this is more of a dream than reality. 
5. I have another optimization project involving computation of some nasty gradient/Hessians. I am thinking about relying on automatic differentiation tools to compute gradient/Hessians for me, an area that I basically know nothing about. Before I even got started, it is pretty sub-ideal that julia have [10-20 packages](https://juliadiff.org) all doing basically the same thing. It seems I should go with `Enzyme.jl` or `Zygote.jl` from what I can gather, is this a good idea? I definitely do NOT have the expertise to fix problems in these AD tools shall I encounter any. If I were in Python world, this wouldn't even be a question because I'll just use JAX. 

Now I find myself wanting my Julia code to be accessible from R/Python. I also want easy access to C++ from Julia without too much effort. I want julia binaries that can run on machines without Julia installed. I want some authoritative figure to tell me, when there are too many options to choose from, which option among a list with 20 options I should use and why. If I encounter problems, I hope I'm not the first person to have to deal with it, but even if I am, **boy I hope I don't have to deal with it by myself**. 

As a scientist, I want to spend most of my time thinking about science, algorithms, and datasets. I came to Julia because it promises to solve the 2 language problem. But ironically, now I find myself needing to double dip in multiple langauges regardless, and therefore I'm *still* spending most of my time crafting workarounds to whatever technical difficulties the 2 language problem entails. If I need to deal with this one way or another, it just doesn't feel right to do so in Julia, because I'll need Bart/Mose/some other important person to specifically look at *my problem*. 

Are my worries/concerns justified? Am I expecting too much? Is the grass greener on the other side?

TL;DR I like julia but I'm not sure if switching to R/Python/something else will make my life easier in the long run. Putting this post here so that future me can decide if what I did was right.
