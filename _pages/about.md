Hi there.

I love [coding](https://github.com/biona001), [speedcubing](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/persons/2012CHUB01), swimming, [anime](https://myanimelist.net/animelist/biona001), [piano](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZS6yb8rXX8), and brewing milk tea! I also used to love jigsaw puzzles, yoyo,  [go](https://online-go.com/player/211599/), calligraphy.... but my interest comes and goes.
