I am currently a Ph.D student in the [biomathematics program](http://www.biomath.ucla.edu/) at UCLA, advised by Kenneth Lange. I am interested in applying mathematics and statistics to study complex biological problems, particularly those arising in genetics and the health sciences. As such, my interest and/or expertise broadly includes:

1. Optimization and computing
1. Statistical and mathematical methods for human genetics
1. System wide biology modeling

I previously worked for professor [Carmay Lim](http://www.ibms.sinica.edu.tw/pi_webpage/blue_style2016/index.php?p_id=34&journal_info_sysid=100612) at the institute of biomedical sciences at Academia Sinica.

Metal cofactor are often drug targets for many kinds of diseases, such as cancer, Alzheimers, hepatitis C, glaucoma...etc. My project focused on computing binding affinities of a variety of drug models, particularly those incovling the zinc ion.
