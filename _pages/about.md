Hi there. My name is Benjamin Chu. I love swimming, [speedcubing](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/persons/2012CHUB01), [anime](https://myanimelist.net/animelist/biona001), [piano](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZS6yb8rXX8), and brewing milk tea. I used to also love jigsaw puzzles, yoyo, go, calligraphy.... but my interest comes and goes.
