I am currently a Ph.D student in the [biomathematics program](http://www.biomath.ucla.edu/) at UCLA, advised by Kenneth Lange. I am interested in applying mathematics and statistics to the study complex biological problems, particularly those arising in genetics and the health sciences. As such, my interest and/or expertise broadly includes:

1. Optimization and computing
1. Statistical and mathematical methods for human genetics
1. System wide biology modeling
