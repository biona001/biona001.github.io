## About me 

I am a postdoc at Stanford university, working under [Chiara Sabatti](https://statweb.stanford.edu/~sabatti/). I got my PhD in [biomathematics](https://compmed.ucla.edu/) at UCLA, advised by Kenneth Lange and Janet Sinsheimer. Before that, I got a BA in mathematics at UC Berkeley. 

My interests broadly include:

1. Statistical and mathematical methods for human genetics/genomics
2. Optimization and scientific computing
3. Writing efficient and user-friendly software packages
